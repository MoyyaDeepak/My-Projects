                <p>Hi papa...
                    I don't know where to start but do you really think one word is sufficient to explain about you. It may be a bit over the top but these are the words you deserve  :- You are more like to me a mother of my children, daughter to my parents, for myself you’re everything to me. you’re are more like a moon, star, smile on my face, sadness, depression, over thinking, best friend, my daughter, sister, blessings from god , pain in my heart, beautiful, matured, pretty, my partner, my first kiss hug, goddess, other half, etc. Inka entha cheppina idhi ela untundhi ante edho oka point lo sollu anipinchachu andhuke inka cheppatle  kani okati cheptha nuvvu na pakkana undadniki em cheyyalo cheppu chestha it can be anything I am ready to do. Finally nuvvu na pakkana unte edhaina sadistha ani nammakam undhi.
                    Finally one word you’re a moon to me but I'm more like one of the stars to you. Because nuvve moon vi andhinatte untav kani eppatiki na dhanivvi kavu. Inka chala chepdham anukunna but in one word more like a "Amma".</p>
